Known Issues
============

- Transactions Tab doesn't reset to "Transactions" when vault is closed.

- Resync menu item, general problems.

- Merkle Blocks in database must be replaced when new accounts are added - otherwise, transactions will not confirm.

- Synching with peer sometimes stops before all merkle blocks have been inserted into db. Workaround, disconnect and reconnect.

- Opening or creating a vault while block header sync is taking place can cause crash. Need synchronization.

- Closing app before block sync is complete results in no progress stored. blocktree should be flushed to disk more often.
