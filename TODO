UI
--

- Icons for the remaining actions.

- Add toolbars for keychain, account, and transaction actions.

- Add account selection drop down in Transactions tab.

- Add option to automatically open whatever vault was open last time application closed. Remember full application state (open tab, selected items) and reload accordingly.

- Remember recently opened vaults, add shortcuts to File menu.

- Add Save As... option to file menu.

- Allow account selection from drop down in Create Transaction dialog. Use selected account as default.

- Redesign dialog layouts (Create Transaction and Request Payment in particular).

- Prompt user to select account if more than one account exists when opening a payment url.

- Remove extraneous, unused objects from UI classes.


General
-------

- Use timer to explicitly request transactions in merkle block if sync gets stuck because the bitcoin node already sent us the transactions when a different vault or no vault was open.

- Filter the mempool ourselves.
